# Chapter 8 : Memory

Although our *Addition Machine* was a complete computer, but actually, a computer without memory is like a car without seats. You know a car can be driven 
without seats, but we add seats, because seats can keep passengers! And this is the point! We want a certain space for keeping data. According to the 
[chapter six](chapter6.md), we know that a *combinational circuit* is a circuit which can solve a logic/arithmetic problem without storing the results. 
In this chapter, we are going to study a new family of circuits, which are called **Sequential Circuits**.

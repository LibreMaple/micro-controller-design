# Introduction 

I always wanted to design a micro controller or micro processor, and I managed to model them. Now, I've decided to show people how a micro controller is designed. And, I'm inspired by [But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computer for Everyone](https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765) by **J.Clark Scott**. I've read this books, and also studied MIPS, ARM and PowerPC architectures, so, in this book, I try to simplify a micro processor and turn it to a micro controller. 

## Audience 
Of course, you need to be geek enough to read this book. I try to simplify topics, but if you have knowledge of logical circuits or micro processors, you'll understand this book easier.

# Introduction 

I always wanted to design a micro controller or micro processor, and I managed to model them. Now, I've decided to show people how a micro controller is designed. And, I'm inspired by [But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computer for Everyone](https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765) by **J.Clark Scott**. I've read this book, and also studied MIPS, ARM and PowerPC architectures, so, in this book, I try to simplify a micro processor and turn it to a micro controller. 

## Audience 
Of course, you need to be geek enough to read this book. I try to simplify topics, but if you have knowledge of logical circuits or micro processors, you'll understand this book easier. 

## What we learn? 
First, you will understand how mankind communicated with machines for years, and the way people communicated with computers is unchanged. Then, you start learning *logical circuits* which is 
base of computer architecture and organization. And importance of knowledge of logical circuits is clear, in university (at least all Iranian universities), you should first pass the *Logical Circuits* course, and then 
you can take *Computer Architecture* course. After learning logical circuits, we start designing simple circuits and even computers, memory blocks, etc. At the end, we combine everything we designed, and it will become our
computer. Finally, we can program our computer, and we actually understand how a computer can understand human's language.

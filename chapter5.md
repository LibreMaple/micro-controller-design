# Chapter 5 : Logical Circuits
Do you remember two logics **NAND** and **NOR** ? These logics are called *Universal Logic*, because
in digital electronics, we make all other logics using these two logics! The smallest part of a logical circuit, is 
called a **gate**. each gate is a specific arrangement of transistors. For example, this is a *NOT gate* using MOSFET 
transistors :

I picked this picture from one of my old projects, and in this book, we won't use any transistor, we just use symbolic schematics
of logic gates to design logical circuits!

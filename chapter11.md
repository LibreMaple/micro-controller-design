# Chapter 11 : Design, Advanced Addition Machine! 

In [chapter seven](chapter7.md) we designed the must simple (and almost useless) computer, *The Addition Machine*. Now, 
we need to have a background of design and implementation of complex machines, so we add some useful features to our addition 
machine. Our machine had no memory blocks and we couldn't save our inputs and outputs. In this chapter, we will learn how to 
add memory blocks to our addition machine.

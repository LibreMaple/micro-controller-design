# Chapter 17 : The Dark Side of The Moon
This is not about Pink Floyd's album, this book has nothing to do with music of course. But, I chose this name because 
a lot of *computer engineers* have no idea about design and implementation of the hardware. So, it can be the dark side! 
Some people, including some computer engineers and electrical engineers, joined the dark side and made computers. But this is 
not all! We had computers before transistors. They were usually electro-mechanical or mechanical. But the theory of computation 
is much older than what you think! ***Khawrazmi***, a Persian scientist, is one of the most known people in history of computer 
science. Even the word ***Algorithm*** is taken from his name. In 1947, *Transistor* discovered, and that was the starting point of 
***Electronic Computers***.

# Chapter 13 : Arithmetic and Logical Unit

This is the start point! In this chapter, we build the main part of our computer, and we will be able to use it in a logical simulator. 
In old days, when computers were weak and expensive, ***ALU*** was an independent part, and it was not integrated with CPU. For example, 
a lot of computers used 74181 IC as the ALU (e.g VAX). Today, ALU, Register file, RAM, etc. Are all integrated in one chip and it's called 
a ***Microcontroller***. But, to understand computer better, we start a modular design, then we put all together, and we'll have a complete 
microcontroller.

# Chapter 10 : Computer Architecture 

This chapter is only theory of computer architecture. Actually, we need to know this part before we can start design
and implementation. There are a lot of concepts we should know. In this chapter, I tried to cover the most important 
concepts. 

## Computer Architecture 

The term *architecture* usually used for everything engineers build, and it means all engineers need to know the architecture
of what they made. *Computer Architecture* is simply operations that a computer can do. Do you remember our ***Addition Machine***? 
That computer had a simple architecture, it could add two numbers, and if one of inputs was negative (according to the operator of computer, not computer itself!) 
it could help us subtract. That's nice, isn't that? So ***All instructions and operations of a computer is its architecture***. This is
the only concept you actually feel when you are a *user*. When you are *engineer* you need to know more concepts.

# Chapter 14 : Program Structure 

In previous chapter, we built the most important part of our microcontroller. In this chapter, we will take a look 
on the theory side of ***programs*** and we will define how our computer will understand programs. This is important indeed, 
because we need to write a simple *assembler* for our computer which can generate *machine code* for us.
